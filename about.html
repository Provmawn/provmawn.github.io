    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>My name is Amman and I am a third year Computer Science major at CSUF. Some of my interests include learning new things, playing video games, and of course computer science. I've been programming ever since my sophomore year in high school. I took a 4 year program called GITA that taught me C#, javascript, actionscript3, and java. I've posted some of the projects I've made on my github (<a href="www.github.com/provmawn" title="provmawn">www.github.com/provmawn</a>). When I graduate I want to go into game development or game engine development. I think it would be really cool to understand how various mechanics in a game work on the back end or how a game works from a completely fundamental perspective. One of games I have been playing is World of Warcraft Classic. It is a pretty nerdy game but also pretty enjoyable if you look past the nerdyness.
